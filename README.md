# Code Statistics

This is a daemon and neovim plugin to record the amount of time I spend coding.
Data is recorded in a binary file to save space and there is no viewer yet, so
while this can record data, there is no easy way to view it. This is designed as
a systemd service, so there may be difficulty using it on a non systemd system.
